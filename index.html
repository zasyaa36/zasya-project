        <h2>I Fall ..</h2><br>
        <p>I fall in love. I fell in love with the sky, I fell in love with the stars, the clouds, the moon, <br>
            I fell in love with all the beauty up there.<br>
            I think astronomy is a very elegant science, studying it made me realize that planet earth 
            <br>is just a grain of dust in the power of the universe.
            I was enchanted by the beauty of the sky, the solar system, 
            <br>the Milky Way Galaxy, the Black Hole, and the Law of Relativity.
            <br> There are still many unsolved mysteries and interesting things that I have never known.
